# Position Trigger Object

> Position Trigger objects monitor movers until they have crossed over a specified location on track, even if they do not stop there.

---

## Setup & Execution

```javascript
// Declaration
PositionTriggerA		: PositionTrigger;
```

```javascript
// Initialization
PositionTriggerA.TrackPosition		:= 2000;
PositionTriggerA.TriggerDirection	:= mcDirectionPositive;
```

---

## Methods

### Cyclic

*Cyclic()*

> Position Triggers require a cyclic call in the Main Program because they need to constantly monitor the positions of registered movers.

---

## Properties

### .MoverPassedPosition

> Status boolean indicating that at least one mover has passed over the threshold position since being registered

Position Triggers are unique in that the Current Mover output *latches* even though the mover may not still qualify under the trigger condition

---

### .CurrentMover

> Reference variable that refers to the earliest registered mover to cross over the track position since being registered

- If no movers are tracked, or no tracked movers have yet satisfied the objective, then .CurrentMover is an invalid reference. In this case, an ErrorMover will replace the invalid reference. The user will receive notifications when this happens in the TwinCAT event logs. See Diagnostics>ErrorMovers for more information. 

- It is recommended that all evaluations are nested inside IF checks for .MoverPassedPosition. 

- It is possible that multiple registered movers have crossed over a threshold position. Only the least recently valid mover handle is provided by .CurrentMover. To access more recent events, deregister the current mover with *PositionTrigger.UnregisterCurrent()*

---

### .TrackPosition

> Current placement of the Position Trigger threshold along the track

---

## Extra Examples

```javascript
// Basic Position Trigger implementation

// Begin monitoring Mover 1
IF bInit THEN
	Mover[1].MoveToPosition( 1000 );
	PositionTrigger.TrackPosition	:= 800;
	PositionTrigger.RegisterMover( Mover[1] );
	bInit	:= FALSE;
END_IF

// When Mover 1 crosses position 800, slow it down to 100mm/s
IF PositionTrigger.MoverPassedPosition THEN
	PositionTrigger.CurrentMover.SetVelocity( 100 );
	PositionTrigger.UnregisterCurrent();
END_IF

```
