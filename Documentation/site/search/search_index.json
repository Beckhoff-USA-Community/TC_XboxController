There will be a zip folder that includes the latest MSI installer for Windows 10. Once the program is installed, you can start the service by launching it from the User Programs menu. A successfully running service should look like this. You can then minimize the application to have it running in the background to host application data. Installing The PLC Library After the service install process, there will be a PLC library placed at the location C:\\Program Files\\Beckhoff Community\\TwinCAT Xbox Controller Service\\PLC Library . You will need to import this into the TwinCAT library repository before being able to use the functions. To do this, right-click the Resources folder inside a PLC project and use the install button.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"GettingStarted/Installation.html#installing-the-service","text":"To make sure you have the latest version, visit the releases page.

This DLL is light weight and C++ based, but it there are specific controllers that it supports. Controllers Supported: Xbox Elite Controller Series Xbox Series X|S controllers Xbox One controllers Xbox 360 controllers Wireless or Wired Connectivity For wired connectivity the configuration is straightforward. As of initial testing, the controllers listed above all function with a simple USB-C to USB-A cable between the IPC and Xbox controller. For wireless connectivity, it is recommended to use the Microsoft official Xbox USB dongle. This dongle allows connection to 4 controllers simultaneously. To use the Microsoft dongle, you will need to install the driver manually or have the system updates enabled. Since Beckhoff CXs/IPCs have updates disabled, there is a provided driver in the MSI installer of the TwinCAT Xbox Controller Service project. Follow these steps to install the driver. Install the project MSI Locate the CAB file at C:\\Program Files\\Beckhoff Community\\TwinCAT Xbox Controller Service\\Offline Installers\\Wireless Drivers Extract the CAB file (using 7-zip or other tool) Right-click -> Install on the driver Plugin dongle NOTE You can attempt to use an off the shelf USB bluetooth dongle to connect the controller wirelessly, however results in testing have been mixed.

Please visit the Getting Started section for the installation of the PLC library. CAUTION! The blocks below use Move Velocity commands under the hood, use at your own risk . Internally, they will copy the original Feedrate Override value of the Axis, and then supply a new one based on the Options Structure provided. Once the bEnable bit turns False, the original Feedrate Override value is copied back into the Axis and it is then halted. The feedrate copy feature is done to allow a smooth ramping based on the force applied to each joystick or trigger. Button Based Helpers The button based helpers can work in two ways; a simple instant jog button, or a rampable jog button. When enabling the ramp feature inside the ST_Xbox_Button_NC_Options struct, the axis will ramp to a specified value based on how long the button is pressed.

Within this documentation you will find the Primary Functions Blocks and the Helper Function Blocks . Both are within the XboxControllerUtilities library for PLC. Please visit the Getting Started section for the installation of the PLC library. Primary Functions Blocks These PLC function blocks are the core interface blocks for connecting an Xbox controller to the PLC. They will enable you to connect multiple controllers, retrieve status bits, stream button values, read battery data, and set force feedback (rumble). Helper Function Blocks The helper function blocks are designed to make connection of an Xbox controller to other TwinCAT items easier. They are mostly wrapper blocks with many different operations happening within. At the moment, there are two helper function block categories supported. NC Axis FBs These help with tasks such as attaching a two axis joystick to two independent NC Axis within TwinCAT. There are FBs to help with attaching a simple button pushes, analog triggers, and joysticks to drive an axis. XPlanar Mover FBs These help with controlling an XPlanar Mover. Instead of needing to write a bunch of setpoint code, the blocks are designed to expedite the connection process and allow you to start driving a mover quickly. Under The Hood How does the TwinCAT Xbox Controller Service work? It's simple! The communication mechanism is TwinCAT's native ADS protocol. You may have seen other joystick or controller connection projects within the GitHub community. This project is special due to it being an ADS Server application. With the most recent update of ADS, there is support for ADS Servers based in .Net Core. Most of the commonly discovered projects within the community are using the ADS CLient connection. Why does Server vs. Client matter? With the Server, you simply need to start the service to begin hosting ADS data. When the PLC reaches out to the service on port 25733 , the service then reaches out to the Xbox controller via XInput to retrieve the latest data. This creates a very easy to use mechanism within the TwinCAT environment. The future road-map of the project (after V1.0) is to create a Windows background service to allow the application to run in the background continuously upon startup. In contrast, the ADS Client applications that are commonly developed are a little more cumbersome to get running. Usually there is a C# application that has to be built and deployed. There might also be the need to modify some PLC variable names within the C# application to insure everything matches on the PLC side. Once the variables are connected within the PLC, they cannon't move and must sit where they were originally configured. Limitations At the moment the project is aimed for Windows IPC/CX support. In the future there are plans to also support TC/BSD, however it will require a different C++ driver within the application to connect to the controller. This is already under development, but it is not the primary focus. Due to XInput, there is a maximum controller count of 4 per TwinCAT Xbox Controller Service. However, this will not stop you from connecting 4+ controllers. Due to the ADS servers nature, you can have the Controller Service running on many IPCs and connect to them remotely from a single PLC. This has been tested with up to 8 controllers, and it even works successfully with an ADS connection via AWS Cloud using ADS-over-MQTT.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"PLCDocs/Overview.html#api-overview","text":"This documentation is to serve as a reference for the TwinCAT Xbox Controller Service and it's common PLC function blocks.
